## Project Description

As web dev bootcamp students, have you ever wanted an easier way to request a tutor based on your availability?

Do you find that you are asking your fellow students what tutor they use and then requesting to be assigned that tutor?

As a current student, I want to spill the tea (review) my tutor(s), be able to edit my review securely, & see active tutors and their reviews from other students so that I can offer my insight on my experience for other students or find a tutor based on my availability and classmates recommendations.

## Installation

Visit https://tutor-tea-brew.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Spill the tea on your tutor or find a new tutor that fits your acquired taste<br>

> User creation, user login, user logout<br>
> View all tutors / Add your tutor <br>
> Add a review<br>
> Includes availability selections, rating (1-5), and a text area with profanity filtering!<br>
> View all reviews<br>

## PRIVACY NOTICE - PLEASE READ

Due to privacy concerns, it is not recommended to enter your actual tutors' name, email, and availability in this site. Please reference the future development section for more details.
## Future Development - from the TutorTea development team

The original inspiration and intention of this project was/is to partner with a school/organization and connect to their Tutor and student database. This would require a series of steps to ensure the privacy and security of the site and the data it connects to externally.

Requirements:
Privacy (third party data usage) and data usage business associate agreements and approval from the bootcamp/school/institution.<br>

> SSL cert to serve it over HTTPS <br>
> Verify that a student is a current enrollee at the respective school <br>
> --(using school issued id/email as requisite for account creation)<br>
> --(matching the information to the institutions' database before user is granted access).<br>
> Tutor approval during their onboarding/hiring process with the educational institution.
>Other agreements, licenses, and contracts as the need arises.

Our goal is to connect the app with tutors and students in bootcamps, schools, educational institutions nationwide.
